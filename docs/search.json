Geodemographic classification is a method used to categorise geographic areas and the people living in them based on demographic, socioeconomic, and sometimes lifestyle characteristics. This approach combines geographic information with demographic data to create profiles of different neighborhoods.\n\n\nYou can download the slides of this week’s lecture here: [Link].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongley, P.

The region is organised into a hierarchical typology composed of 7 Supergroups and 16 Groups, created using data from 2021 Census data. The LOAC uses 68 variables across several domains: demography, ethnicity and origins, living arrangements, usual residence, health and education and employment (see Singleton and Longley 2024).\nToday, we will create our own geodemographic classification at the LSOA level using a subset of the 2021 Census LOAC variables to examine demographic patterns across London. Specifically, we will focus on age group, self-identified ethnicity, and country of birth. Additionally, we will include data on an individual’s first or preferred language. The data represent all usual residents as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, and have been extracted using the Custom dataset tool. You can download copies of each file via the provided links. Save these files in your project folder under data.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Age Groups\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Country of Birth\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Ethnicity\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Main Language\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a geodemographic classification is an iterative process. This typically includes adding or removing variables, adjusting the number of clusters, and grouping data in different ways to achieve the most meaningful segmentation. If you want to refine your clustering solution, you can re-run the analysis with different variables or cluster numbers by simply updating your code. However, automating parts of this process with a function would streamline the workflow and make it more efficient.\nTry to create a simple R function that:\n\nTakes at least three arguments: a data frame containing the input data, the number of clusters you want, and a list of input variables.\nExecutes a k-means clustering on the specified input variables and number of clusters.\nGenerates a csv file that contains a table of means for each cluster in the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour function could be structured like this: run-kmeans(df, k, vars), where df is your input dataframe, k is the number of clusters, and vars is a list of input variables.\nFor a more in-depth discussion on constructing functions in R, refer to Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science Chapter on Functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving finished this tutorial, you should now understand the basics of a geodemographic classification.
